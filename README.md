# ONN - the organic neural network

The purpose of this app is to explore a new form of deep learning. This is type is intended to resembles the current understanding of neurological functioning. Reflecting connectomics (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtTOg0mzRJc) and eventually neuroconstructivism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17181703).

This project was started to overcome the simplicity of mechanisms of machine learning, specifically how nodes in machine learning were typically treated as simplistic entities that are represented by a number between 1 and 0. However, this is far from the truth. Neurones continually adapt change, can fire a multitude of different type of signals that can be inhibitory or excitatory. There are over 100 different types of neurones. Some of which have the capability to mutate into other neurones. 

Connectomics asserts that the human brain starts out like an interconnected mess, where all neurones are connected as much as possible to other neurones. This is inefficient, imagine if you’re working in a company and you need to relay a memo to your boss. However, no one told you what your boss looks like: you ask everyone if you are the boss. However, now imagine that no one else in the building knows their role. Everyone responds: “I might be your boss…”. This starts to explain why children brain start out so interconnected but when they reach adulthood their brain has a 10th of the connections. An order has been established where solid connections and hierarchies have been established. 

In its current form, the app functions in order to test the most basic principle. The logic of having unipolar neurones act as sensory neurones rather than bipolar. Unipolar neurones are the most simplistic neurones. They receive a signal and then relay the signal without much input, they can be suppressed but ultimate internally they are quite incapable of significant change. They are effectively your wires in the circuit setup.

Unipolar neurones are the typical type for skin receptors. Bipolar requires unnecessary architecture in order to achieve the same result, not unlike doing an unnecessary test for a signal which always be relayed. 

The experiment here is to have four different neurones:
1 - unipolar but relays an incorrect signal. 
2 - unipolar and relays an correct signal. 
3 - bipolar and relays an incorrect signal. 
4 - bipolar and relays an incorrect signal. 

The system is set up so that each neurone will expend energy relaying a system, unipolar not as much as bipolar. Each neurone has a finite amount of resources to expend. They will also, be rewarded with resources if they accurate relay the message. The resources given will be relative to those expended by all neurones.
